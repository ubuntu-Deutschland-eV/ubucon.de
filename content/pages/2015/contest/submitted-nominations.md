Mario Kamenjak
--------------

Category: Non-Technical

Achievements:

Mario has been working hard during the last weeks to summarize the
weekly Ubuntu community Q&A sessions on his [personal
blog](http://thebluedrag.blogspot.de/) and has then
[shared](https://plus.google.com/+OnajTamo/posts) the blog posts on
Google Plus. From the
[comments](https://plus.google.com/+OnajTamo/posts/KzBgCKEX6Xv)
[over](https://plus.google.com/+OnajTamo/posts/7AkrRrQzq2J)
[there](https://plus.google.com/+OnajTamo/posts/Yo7XTUypWTz) one can
judge that his summaries have helped a lot of people, including me. Most
weeks I don't have time to spend a whole hour watching the Q&A sessions
so the summaries come in handy as they give me a great overview of what
has been discussed and allow me to rewatch the parts which I am
interested in by providing the respective time when a question was
asked.

Additionally, he wrote a few cool Ubuntu related blog posts before that,
e.g.
[here](http://thebluedrag.blogspot.de/2015/07/why-ubuntu-unity8ubuntu-on-phones-and.html)
and

Aggelos Arnaoutis
-----------------

Category: Non-Technical

Achievements:

Aggelos is a university student in Greece and has been helping with the
translation of Ubuntu (emphasis on phone-related packages). His
launchpad page is <https://launchpad.net/~angelosarn> and for his
translations he reached to 9500 of karma.

He has translated:

-   Packages related to Ubuntu phone, including apps that are found in
    the Ubuntu store (Weather by Michael Zanetti, podbird,
    my-webapp-group, delivery tracker, network scanner).
-   General Ubuntu packages, Xubuntu packages, Linux Mint packages and
    Enlightment packages.

Niklas Wenzel
-------------

Category: Technical

Achievements:

-   Niklas has given an outstanding effort in his work on implementing
    [IMAP
    notifications](http://nikwen.github.io/ubuntu/2015/09/17/my-work-on-email-notifications.html)
    into the accounts-polld service. It's a feature that has been
    missing for a long time now due to the platform app lifecycle
    policy, and I applaud his effort to try and do something about it.
-   He is also a frequent committer to core-apps and is always providing
    help & advice on mailing lists, XDA and Ubuntu related social
    network groups.
