sure that you're allowed to participate.

 * Make sure you've understood all the rules. If you have any questions,
please [contact us](mailto:contest-ubucon-de@lists.ubuntu-eu.org).
Do not register other people, and do not register yourself more than
once.

 * Do not register entries that aren't your own work, are not fully
licensed under an open source license, etc. See the [Terms of
Entry](sites/ubucon.de/files/UbuContest-Termsofentry_0.pdf) for a list
of requirements.

 * You may register up to two entries, but please do not register projects
that other teams/individuals have already submitted.
The deadline for the submission of all entries to the Ubuntu Software

releases turning up before that date!

the competition! Send screenshots, small status updates, Tweets etc!
