    sure that you and all members of your team are allowed to
    participate.

    questions, please [contact
    us](mailto:contest-ubucon-de@lists.ubuntu-eu.org).

    do not register an individual with more than one team at the same
    time.
-   Do not register entries that aren't your own work, are not fully
    licensed under an open source license, etc. See the [Terms of
    Entry]({filename}/files/UbuContest-Termsofentry_0.pdf) for a
    list of requirements.
-   You may register up to two entries, but please do not register
    projects that other teams/individuals have already submitted.
-   The deadline for the submission of all entries to the Ubuntu
    Software Store is September 18, 15:00 UTC, but we would really love
    to see beta releases turning up before that date!
-   If you register, please keep us up-to-date about your progress
    during the competition! Send screenshots, small status updates,
    Tweets etc!
