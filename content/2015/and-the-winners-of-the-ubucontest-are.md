Canonical Ltd., the Ubucon Germany 2015 team, and the UbuContest 2015
team, are happy to announce the results of the first UbuContest today!
Over the last couple of months our community developers from all over
the world have worked hard to create innovative and creative apps and
scopes for the converging Ubuntu world of the future. 22 contest entry
submissions qualified for the contest, and we received seven nominations
for the „Outstanding contribution“ categories.


So without any further ado: Here are the winners!


**Best Team Entry**: First place goes to Team ReMoTe for
„[Falldown](https://uappexplorer.com/app/falldown.rpadovani)“, which
already was the most popular game in the store last month. Second place
goes to Team UbunTouch-fr for their
„[OpenFoodFacts](https://uappexplorer.com/app/openfoodfacts.ubuntouch-fr)“
app, which we featured in our first UbuContest Story.


**Best Individual Entry**: First place goes to Simon Stürz for „[Monster
Wars](https://uappexplorer.com/app/monsterwars.t-mon)", another game
that immediately became popular among our users. The incredibly
addicting „[Click the
Cookie](https://uappexplorer.com/app/clickthecookie.jjvannielen)“ game
got Jorik van Nielen the second place, and the third place is awarded to
the popular
„[WifiTransfer](https://uappexplorer.com/app/wifitransfer.sil)“ utility
written by Stuart Langridge.


**The Outstanding Non-Technical Contribution** category is awarded to
Kevin Feyder for his many design contributions to various projects.


**The Outstanding Technical Contribution category** is awarded to Niklas
Wenzel for his continuous work on the core apps and especially for
working on IMAP notifications.


**Convergence Hero**: The jury decided to not award a prize in this
category. While many of the contest entries already work more than one
form-factor, e.g. phone and desktop, out of the box, no entry made
creative use of the possibilities.


We congratulate all the winners and hope to meet you all at Ubucon
Germany 2015 in Berlin.
