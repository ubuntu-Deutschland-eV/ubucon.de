Canonical Ltd., the Ubucon Germany 2015 team, and the UbuContest 2015
team, are happy to announce the first UbuContest today! We are excited
to bring you an engaging, enlightening, community-organised competition,
where the Ubuntu community brings forward innovative, creative and
incredible apps, scopes and ideas for the converging Ubuntu world of the
future. Contestants from all over the world will have until September
18, 2015 to build and publish their apps and scopes using the Ubuntu SDK
and Ubuntu platform, starting today.


We know it's not all about shiny new apps and scopes! A great platform
also needs content, great design, testing, documentation, bug
management, developer support, interesting blog posts, news, technology
demonstrations and all of the other incredible things our community does
every day. So we give you, our community members, the opportunity to
nominate other community members for prizes!


We are proud to present five dedicated categories:


1.  **Best Team Entry**: A team of up to three developers may register
    up to two apps/scopes they are developing. The jury will assign
    points in categories including "Creativity", "Functionality",
    "Design", "Technical Level" and "Convergence". The top three entries
    with the most points win.
2.  **Best Individual Entry**: A lone developer may register up to two
    apps/scopes he or she is developing. The rest of the rules are
    identical to the "Best Team Entry" category.
3.  **Outstanding Technical Contribution**: Members of the general
    public may nominate candidates who, in their opinion, have done
    something "exceptional" with an Ubuntu-based device, Unity8, Mir,
    etc. on a technical level. Each jury member has one vote, and the
    nominated candidate with the most jury votes wins.
4.  **Outstanding Non-Technical Contribution**: Members of the general
    public may nominate candidates who, in their opinion, have done
    something exceptional, but non-technical, to bring the Ubuntu
    platform forward. So, for example, you can nominate a friend who has
    reported and commented on all those phone-related bugs on Launchpad.
    Or nominate a member of your local community who did translations
    for Core Apps. Or nominate someone who has contributed
    documentation, written awesome blog articles, etc. The rest of the
    rules are identical to the "Outstanding Technical Contribution"
    category.
5.  **Convergence Hero**: The "Best Team Entry" or "Best Individual
    Entry" contribution with the highest number of "Convergence" points
    wins. The winner in this category will probably surprise us in ways
    we have yet to imagine.


Our community jury panel members Laura Cowen, Carla Sella, Simos
Xenitellis, Sujeevan Vijayakumaran and Michael Zanetti will select the
winners in each category. Successful winners will be awarded items from
a huge pile of prizes, including travel subsidies for the first-placed
winners to attend Ubucon Germany 2015 in Berlin, four Ubuntu Phones
sponsored by bq and Meizu, t-shirts, and bundles of items from the
official Ubuntu Shop.


We wish all the contestants good luck!
