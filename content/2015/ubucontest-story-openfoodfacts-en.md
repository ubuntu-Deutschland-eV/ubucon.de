One of the first participants who responded to our interview call was
Jimmy Lejeune, the team leader of Team UbunTouch-fr. His team develops
the “OpenFoodFacts” app, which provides access to
[OpenFoodFacts](http://us.openfoodfacts.org/), a “food products database
made by everyone, for everyone”.

</p>
The database does not only list ingredients, but many other details like
nutritional value, packaging, a list of stores which sell the product, a
list of countries it is sold in etc.

</p>
The OpenFoodFacts app for Ubuntu acts as a frontend to the website and
adapts the information to the phone screen. Judging from the
screenshots, the user interface is nice and tidy. You can find the app
in the [Ubuntu App
Store](https://uappexplorer.com/app/openfoodfacts.ubuntouch-fr).

</p>
**How did you come up with the idea for your app?**

</p>
It started with a proposal to make an application received through our
website [ubuntouch-fr.org](http://ubuntouch-fr.org/). We have chosen to
create this application because we want to reach as many users as
possible.

</p>
**How long have you been working on it?**

</p>
We are working on this application since 06/16/2015.

</p>
<strong>What are your experiences with the Ubuntu platform? Was it easy
to  

build your app, what were the challenges?</strong>

</p>
The biggest challenge is the creation of the icon, in fact the current
time we still do not have an icon :)

</p>
<strong>How do you develop your app? Do you already own an Ubuntu
phone/tablet, do you use the desktop, or maybe both?</strong>

</p>
All persons involved in the application developement already own an
Ubuntu phone (“official” or not).

</p>
**How did you hear about UbuContest? When did you decide to enter?**

</p>
We have heard of UbuContest thanks to the Ubuntu Developer Blog
[article](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/07/23/announcing-the-ubucontest-2015/).
We talked about it before we decided whether we would participate or
not.

</p>
**If you win first place, will you travel to Ubucon Germany in Berlin?
If no, why so?**

</p>
Yes we will take the time to travel for the chance to meet you.

</p>
**How are you going to split the prizes among your team members?**

</p>
We will see when it happens, because we are not after the prizes but
participate to show that the site is fully invested on Ubuntu for
mobiles.
